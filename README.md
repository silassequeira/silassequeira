In this assignment, I created my own portefolio static website.

### Index 
Page displaying a picture of me and some of my work.

General overview of the website with links to either my "About" or "Projects" page. Has a simple layout for displaying content, and gets responsive when the page is less than 950px, either by changing the size of the image-containers or by changing the grid layout to have one column instead of two. Uses a script to move the buttons in a responsive way, and another one to interact with the images, either moving them down, up, left, right depending on the image width and height.


### About
Page displaying a dad joke fetched from an API [https://icanhazdadjoke.com], a paragraph related to who I am, and some of my contact information.

Page mostly related to who I am as a person with an illustration I did of myself, I reuse the layout from the index page to use two columns, and the content also get responsive and also uses media queries, uses scripts for fetching and displaying the api fetched joke, and another one for moving the image to a more responsive location when the page width is less than 950px.


### Projects
Displays some of my projects with more detail and images/videos.

Page has a lot more interactability, like the project containers being displayed when the user scrolls down the page, and also a simple carousel so that the user can see more content related to that specific project, uses again the script to interact with images, and also gets responsive moving the images to a place that makes more sense when the width of page is less 950px.
