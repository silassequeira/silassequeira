                            Lobster”
                            directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, which portrays a dystopia where people are forced to get
                            married, have a partner,
                            or be turned into animals. In this goal, we implemented the website where the user must
                            register, fill out a form with personal questions and then they can choose and match the
                            suggested people. They can then book a room and choose activities with their match or
                            choose
                            another person and have access to their profile.

                            during our second year in the Bachelor's Degree program in Design and Multimedia at the
                            Faculty of Sciences and Technology of the University of Coimbra, unde the guidance of
                            professors Artur Rebelo, Eduardo Mota and Tiago Martins. Ciclo de Conversas Design e
                            Multimédia is a series of talks organized yearly b teachers of the Bachelor and Master
                            programs in Design and Multimedia of the University of Coimbra. Each year, students are
                            grouped and tasked with creating a proposal for the visual identity of the event, and one of
                            the proposals is chosen by the organizing committee to be used in the following years CCDM.
                            When developing the visual identity, we took in consideration how CCDM was an event made by
                            designers, for designers, which for us meant that we could push boundaries, making an
                            experimental, abstract and dynamic identity. We decided we wanted to explore the idea of
                            letters as abstract and distorted shapes, and since the visual identity would be heavily
                            digital, we focused on randomized and generative design. Our final result was a bright and
                            randomized visual identity. We defined eight different two-tone color palettes and designed
                            a logo that could be randomly distorted. With the help of JavaScript and P5JS, we were able
                            to develop a website with shapes that morphed randomly and continuously, using perlin noise
                            to limit and control the distortion. The website was also made to be interactive, since
                            every click changed the color palette, and the user could influence the speed of the
                            morphing. The project's main focus was to create a web identity, however, during every phase
                            of the project we always considered whether our ideas could be executed without programming
                            or not. Therefore, every random aspect of our identity can be replicable manually, from
                            simply choosing one of the many color palettes or by distorting the logo using a series of
                            set rules.

                            looking for his moment of rest and pleasure at the end of a work day. The protagonist of
                            this story encounters a problem when he tries to light his cigarette: his lighter doesn't
                            work. This obstacle forces him, desperately, to search for other alternatives to light his
                            cigarette. Software used: Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects.

                        <p class="textLimiter">"A Joke" is a card game with the goal of promoting dialogue and using a
                            story as a tool to understand each player's perspectives and opinions on various subjects.
                            This game has two decks: one with narrative cards that contain a part of the text and a
                            question related to that excerpt, and one with utility cards that allow players to change
                            the course of the game or answer more questions. The narrative cards must be ordered from 1
                            to 21 and the utility cards can be in random order; both decks must be face down. The first
                            player is chosen randomly, draws a narrative card, reads the text and asks the respective
                            question to another player of their choice. That player draws a utility card before
                            answering and does what is on the card (if it is another question the player has to answer
                            both); the player who answered is the next to read. The utility cards have several functions
                            that influence the game. For example, the "wind" card allows the player initially chosen to
                            answer to choose another player to answer in their turn; the "slide" card makes the player
                            have a time limit of 10s to answer. These cards are repeated throughout the deck, except for
                            the "I love you, Nadia" card which is unique and has the question "Do you think love is a
                            joke?". The game is based on the previously delivered editorial object. The game consists
                            of answering yes or no questions related to Anton Chekhov's short story "A Joke," mostly
                            about love. This game visually features the two characters from the story, descending the
                            hill in a snowy and mountainous environment. The player clicks left or right on the computer
                            keys, and when they are on the side referring to their answer, they click on the computer
                            space bar and proceed to the next question. At the end, after answering all the questions,
                            the player receives an answer about their choices. Software used: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe
                            Photoshop, Processing.

                        <p class="textLimiter">This project is a Single Page Web Application called Art Rush. It
                            features a React-based front-end powered by Vite and a Node.js/Express backend with MongoDB
                            for the database. The application allows users to browse, save &amp; rate historic european
                            artworks. The application encrypts passwords in such a way that even the developers cannot
                            access the utility passwords. The application is highly flexible and suitable for computers,
                            phones, tablets, as well as its desktop version.Another interactive feature is that the
                            background color of the web page changes to match the background color of the user's
                            browser. If the browser background is white, the page will display a white background.
                            Similarly, if the browser background is black, the page will also have a black background.
